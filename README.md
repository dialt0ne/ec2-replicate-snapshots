## ec2-replicate-snapshots

### Overview

`ec2-replicate-snapshots` has been designed to work with
[ec2-consistent-snapshot](https://github.com/alestic/ec2-consistent-snapshot) and
[ec2-expire-snapshots](https://github.com/alestic/ec2-expire-snapshots)
to copy EBS snapshot backups to another region for disaster recovery purposes.

### Usage

```
usage: ec2-replicate-snapshots [-h] [-D] [-B] -s SOURCE -d DESTINATION

Copies EC2 snapshots from one region to another

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -D, --debug           output at debug level
  -B, --botodebug       enable boto debugging (not enabled with -D)
  -s SOURCE, --source SOURCE
                        Source EC2 region
  -d DESTINATION, --destination DESTINATION
                        Destination EC2 region
```

### Example

```
VOLID="vol-5calable"
ec2-consistent-snapshot \
    --region us-east-1 \
    --freeze-filesystem /data \
    --description "important data" \
    $VOLID > >(
        ec2-replicate-snapshots \
            --source us-east-1 \
            --destination us-west-2
    ) 2> >( logger -t snapshot-backups )
ec2-expire-snapshots \
    --keep-first-hourly 48 --keep-first-daily 14 --keep-first-weekly 8 --keep-first-monthly 24 \
    --region us-east-1 \
    $VOLID
ec2-expire-snapshots \
    --keep-first-hourly 48 --keep-first-daily 14 --keep-first-weekly 8 --keep-first-monthly 24 \
    --region us-west-2 \
    --volume-id-in-tag MasterVolumeId \
    $VOLID
```

The above does the following:

* calls `ec2-consistent-snapshot` to do the following
    + creates a snapshot of the EBS volume `vol-5calable` in us-east-1
    + adds the description to the snapshot
    + run [fsfreeze](http://linux.die.net/man/8/fsfreeze) to stop writes to `/data` during the snapshot
    + writes the snapshot id to STDOUT for `ec2-replicate-snapshots`
    + writes errors to STDERR which are sent to syslog via logger
* calls `ec2-replicate-snapshots` to do the following
    + reads the snapshot id from STDIN
    + waits for the snapshot to complete (30 minutes)
    + starts the copy to another region, in this case us-west-2 (or retries for 30 minutes if too many copies are in-flight)
    + waits for the copy to complete (6 hours)
* calls `ec2-expire-snapshots` twice to do the following
    + expire snapshots in us-east-1 for `vol-5calable`
        - keeping 2 days of hourlies
        - keeping 2 weeks fo dailies
        - keeping 2 months of weekies
        - keeping 2 years fo monthlies
    + expire snapshots in us-west-2 for volumes that have the tag with key MasterVolumeId and value `vol-5calable`
        - keeping 2 days of hourlies
        - keeping 2 weeks fo dailies
        - keeping 2 months of weekies
        - keeping 2 years fo monthlies

### tl;dr

```
ec2-consistent-snapshot $SNAPARGS | ec2-replicate-snapshots $REPLARGS
ec2-expire-snapshots $EXPIREARGS $PRIMARYREGION
ec2-expire-snapshots $EXPIREARGS $SECONDARYREGION
```

### ToDos

* Fail louder. Need to know when DR isn't right.
* Move timeouts into command line arguments.
